# The Build System

This project uses the [gulp.js](http://http://gulpjs.com/) task management system.

Each gulp task has been split apart into its own file. This helps to keep the system modular and maintainable.

For the most part, each task should be self-explanatory. If you are unsure what a specific task is doing, refer to the 
documentation in the [NPM registry](http://npmjs.org/) for the specific packages being used.
