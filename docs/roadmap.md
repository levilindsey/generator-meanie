# Project Roadmap

- Add gzip compression (https://github.com/expressjs/compression)
- Add streamlined cache busting (I already have an elegant back-end system in mind from another project, but I need to research the best way general of cache-busting filename references on the front-end)
- Add a little more database infrastructure
- Add authentication using the passport middleware and ui-router's `resolve` property
- Add more/better front-end unit tests
- Add a backend unit testing infrastructure using Mocha with chai
- Add infrastructure for end-to-end tests (https://github.com/angular/protractor)
- Incorporate traceur (for transpiling ES6) into the build process
- Add Yeoman sub-generators for adding additional components later in the development process
